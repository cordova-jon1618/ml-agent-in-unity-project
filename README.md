INTRODUCTION
	With the growing popularity of Unity as a game engine, integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence practices into various applications, such as virtual reality, game development, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, has become increasingly relevant. Our interest in this proposal is to explore the limits of what an ML agent is capable of doing in a Unity workspace environment. 
We have chosen to train an ML agent to navigate through obstacle courses, as it is a vital skill for numerous applications. Through our research, we discovered that the Unity application is an excellent environment for training real-world agents, whether it is a robot learning to kick a ball or a self-driving car, as real-world agents are often trained and tested in virtual environments like Unity. We will be using reinforcement learning to train our ML agent, as it is an effective technique that enables an agent to learn from its environment through trial and error. Our report will explore the design goals, system behavior, logical view, process view, development view, physical view, and use case view of this project. 
Overall, our aim is to gain a better understanding of how ML agents can be trained in a Unity environment using reinforcement learning and to investigate the potential applications of such agents.
